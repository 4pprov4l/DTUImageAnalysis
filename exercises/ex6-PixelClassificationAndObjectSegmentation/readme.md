# Exercise 6 - Pixel classification and object segmentation (work in progress)

In the first part of this exercise, we will use pixel classification to label pixels in an image. In the second part, pixel classification will be combined with BLOB analysis to segment organs from a computed tomography (CT) scan.


## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should be able to do the following:

1. Do Pixel classification

## Installing Python packages

In this exercise, we will be using both [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). You should have these libraries installed, else instructions can be found in the previous exercises.

We will use the virtual environment from the previous exercise (`course02502`).
