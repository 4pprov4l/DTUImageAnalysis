# Introduction

The goal of this exercise is to create a small program for real-time change detection using OpenCV.

# Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should be able to do the following:

-  Use OpenCV to access a web-camera or the camera or a mobile phone.
-  Use the OpenCV function \texttt{cvtColor} to convert from color to gray scale,
-  Convert images from integer to floating point using the \texttt{astype} function.
-  Convert image from floating point to uint8 using the \texttt{astype} function.
-  Compute a floating point absolute difference image between a new and a previous image.
-  Compute the frames-per-second of an image analysis system.
-  Show text on an image using the OpenCV function \texttt{putText}.
-  Display an image using the OpenCV function \texttt{imshow}.
-  Implement and test a change detection program.
-  Update a background image using a linear combination of the previous background image and a new frame.
-  Compute a binary image by thresholding an absolute difference image.
-  Compute the total number of changed pixels in a binary image.
-  Implement a simple decision algorithm that is based on counting the amount of changed pixels in an image.
